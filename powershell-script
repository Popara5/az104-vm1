Use Stop-AzVM to deallocate your virtual machine. Type Yes to confirm
Stop-AzVM `

****Use Get-AzVM with the -Status parameter to verify the machine is deallocated.
Did you know? When you use Azure to stop your virtual machine, the status is deallocated. This means that any non-static public IPs are released, and you stop paying for the VMâ€™s compute costs.
